## Summary

This is a study project about React and related technologies, mainly the following:
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
- [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

## Getting Started

1. Install Node Package Manager version 2
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm i webpack -g` to install webpack globally
4. Run `npm run prod` to generate the bundled JS code production-ready (or `npm run dev`) for debugging-ready
5. Open `index.html` in a web browser

## Structure

- `package.json`: provides list of project dependencies
- `webpack.config.js`: provides `Babel` configuration to generate bundled Javascript (`./js/bundle.js`)
- `index.html`: web page, includes a `<div>` identified as `root` that will be used to inject the Javascript code
- `app`
  - `index.jsx`: provides the page layout, includes a navigation bar, a body with 2 tabs (see below), and a footer
  - `github.jsx`: includes the configuration and the component to render the github information
  - `debug.jsx`: includes the log panel
  - `components.jsx`: provides a template to generate custom tables based on configuration and real or fake data
  - `logger.jsx`: provides the functions required to wire logs generated by tables with the log panel
  - `data.jsx`: provides fake data to test the application without connecting to data endpoints

### Data

At the moment data is retrieving by means of GET requests to the following data endpoints:

| Entity | Data Endpoints |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Github | `https://api.github.com/users/flopezlasanta/repos` |

The response received will be in JSON format.

### How To

- To change the links in the navigation bar or the text in the footer edit `./app/index.jsx` file
- To change data endpoints, table contents, table format for an entity edit `./app/github.jsx`
- To change fake data edit `./app/data.jsx`
- To use fake data use `this.fakeData();` in function `componentDidMount()` from `./app/components.jsx`
- To use real data use `this.fetchData();` in function `componentDidMount()` from `./app/components.jsx`
- To develop with hot-reloading run `npm run start` and then open `http://localhost:9001/`
  - After that changes made in any `.jsx` file will be automatically reloaded in the browser

## Technology

### Core Technologies

- **React**: JS library for building view layer based on components and in a declarative manner
  - **JSX**: JS extension that allows HTML tag syntax to render components
  - **ES6**: is the major update for ECMAScript standard since ES5 (2009): arrows, classes, generators…
  - A quick comparison: Angular 2 puts JS into HTML while React puts HTML into JS
- **React Bootstrap**: JS library that provides reusable React components similar to Bootstrap
- **React Bootstrap Table**: JS library that provides a React component for an advanced Bootstrap table
- **Redux**: JS library for state containment: single source of truth, read-only state, change with reducers
- **Axios**: JS library for promise (asynchronous) based HTTP clients
- Extras:
  - **Moment**: JS library to parse, validate, manipulate and display dates
  - **Immutable**: JS library for immutable collections (Maps, Lists…)

### Development Environment

- **NPM**: Node Package Manager is the package manager for JS 
- **Webpack**: module bundler which takes modules with dependencies and generates a single bundle
  - **React Hot Loader Plugin**: plugin for Webpack and Babel that enables hot reloading
- **Babel**: provides a transpiler for writing next generation JS
  - Development with React based on JSX and ES6 is more productive
  - However JSX syntax and ES6 are not supported by all browsers
  - Babel uses loaders to translate the source code before bundling

## TODO

- [ ] Add `ESLint` to `Babel`
- [ ] Add auto-reloading (every minute or so) with `setInterval`; should be possible to disable
- [ ] Explore usage or `React Scripts` and `React Router`
- [ ] Fix script for `webpack -p` in `package.json`
- [ ] Store data collected from endpoints into `redux` so that we can create tabs joining data from different sources
- [ ] Explore usage of actions / reducers for `axios` requests
- [ ] Upgrade to use `npm 3` instead of `npm 2`
- [ ] Fix warning (iterator) reported by Chrome Developer Tool
- [ ] Explore migrating to *Semantic UI* (vs Bootstrap), creating a branch for that
- [ ] Work on existing and additional contents / tabs! LinkedIn, Twitter, to start with...
- [ ] Configure Travis CI and other integrations
